        <p>
          Hi! <br />
          My name is Kirsty. <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m half-Kiwi and half-Filipino, but have lived most of my life in New
          Zealand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The quick version of why I’m attending Dev Academy is I got extremely
          sick with Covid last year, I have Long Covid now, and I got to the
          point (months ago) where I needed to give up my career in Anaesthesia
          (because of illness and a shift in life priorities). I have limited
          knowledge about coding at the moment, but I know many people
          (including my partner) who love their jobs in tech, and I’m excited to
          see if it’s something I enjoy too.
