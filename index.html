      Hi! <br />
      My name is Kirsty. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m half-Kiwi and half-Filipino, but have lived most of my life in New
      Zealand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quick version of why I’m attending Dev Academy is I got extremely sick
      with Covid last year, I have Long Covid now, and I got to the point
      (months ago) where I needed to give up my career in Anaesthesia (because
      of illness and a shift in life priorities). I have limited knowledge about
      coding at the moment, but I know many people (including my partner) who
      love their jobs in tech, and I’m excited to see if it’s something I enjoy
      too.
    </p>
