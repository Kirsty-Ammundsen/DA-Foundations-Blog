    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! <br />
      My name is Kirsty. <br />
      I’m half-Kiwi and half-Filipino, and while I predominantly relate to a
      more Kiwi world-view, being mixed has often made me question my identity
      and values. The quick version of why I’m attending Dev Academy is I got
      extremely sick with Covid last year, I have Long Covid now, and I got to
      the point (months ago) where I needed to give up my career in Anaesthesia
      (because of illness and a shift in life priorities). I have limited
      knowledge about coding at the moment, but I know many people (including my
      partner) who love their jobs in tech, and I’m excited to see if it’s
      something I enjoy too.
