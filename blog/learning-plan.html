    <ol>
      <li>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li>
      <p>
        My long term goal is still the same - it is to work with a medically
        focused tech company to improve the lives of patients and/or doctors.
        I'd like to end up in some sort of managerial role where I work with
        people a lot, but don't yet have any specific destination in mind. When
        I leave Dev Academy I would be happy with any entry web development job.
      </p>
      <li>
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </li>
      <p>
        Strengths – honest, organised, and thorough. <br />
        Limitations – social anxiety, easily frustrated, take criticism
        personally, and imposter syndrome. I feel that I still have these same
        strengths and limitations, I just want to add that becoming easily
        exhausted is still one of them, and could really impact my bootcamp
        experience.
      </p>
      <li>
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </li>
      <p>
        Speaking in front of the group - this will be pretty terrifying for me -
        and perhaps staying focused for the 9 weeks. I've noticed my energy
        levels have started dipping at the end of this Foundations period.
      </p>
      <li>
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </li>
      <p>
        I would like to work on public speaking and developing leadership
        skills. I also need to work on receiving negative feedback while keeping
        a positive growth mindset.
      </p>
      <li>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</li>
      <p>
        I expect that they will provide opportunities for me to work on my
        public speaking, leadership and the feedback goals stated above. My hope
        is that I can reach out to them if I'm getting exhausted and that there
        might be some workarounds for this.
      </p>
      <li>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</li>
      <p>
        I expect to keep up with the learning objectives and be able to start
        looking for a job at the end of bootcamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have started making friends from the foundations course - and they
        have been very helpful when I get stuck. They will be able to guide me
        towards help if I need it.
      </p>

    <ol>
      <li>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li>
      <p>
        My long term goal is to work with a medically focused tech company to
        improve the lives of patients and/or doctors.
      </p>
      <li>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </li>
      <p>
        Strengths – honest, organised, and thorough. <br />
        Limitations – social anxiety, easily frustrated, take criticism
        personally, and imposter syndrome.
      </p>
      <li>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </li>
      <p>
        Increase my self-confidence, my public speaking ability, and improve my
        receptiveness to criticism/feedback.
      </p>
      <li>How will you manage your workload in this programme?</li>
      <p>
        I plan to work steadily throughout this course, making a commitment to
        doing at least 30min of coursework on the weekends as well. I also have
        no other full-time responsibilities – like kids or work.
      </p>
      <p>
        If things are building up and getting to me, I am likely to reach out
        for support and let the facilitator know. This is a significant issue
        for me, because I still have lingering energy issues and occasionally
        need to stop and take a nap if I’ve been working too much.
      </p>
      <li>How and where you will seek help in a timely way?</li>
      <p>
        My partner has been through a lot with my illness in the last year, and
        is very aware of how I am when I am not doing well. If I do not start to
        seek help (which I am also very likely to do), he will make sure that I
        follow through. It depends a lot on the help that I need, technical help
        could be gained from google, my partner, my homegroup, my facilitator.
        And emotional help will be from my partner and close friends.
      </p>
      <li>What do you expect from the Facilitation team?</li>
      <p>
        To help me develop my programming skills by letting me learn, and
        answering questions when things are too hard to google. Make sure I
        don’t fall behind, and let me know that is important to focus on, but
        what can also be neglected for now if timing doesn’t allow. I’d also
        appreciate positive feedback (especially if I already have negative
        feedback), it’s important for me to know I’m on the right track and that
        my work isn’t awful.
      </p>
      <li>
        Do you have any scheduling information such as block-out times when you
        are committed to other things?
      </li>
      <p>
        I have a few extremely important events (which will hopefully not impact
        my bootcamp experience) but will be a significant drain on my energy. I
        have a hen’s weekend, my best friend’s wedding, and my partners 30th
        birthday all in October. If I was well, none of these things would be an
        issue, but my illness can flare unexpectedly.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is possible that I will need to recover from one or all of these
        weekends and may lose a Monday here or there.
      </p>
