    <ol>
      <li>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li>
      <p>
        My long term goal is to work with a medically focused tech company to
        improve the lives of patients and/or doctors.
      </p>
      <li>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </li>
      <p>
        Strengths – honest, organised, and thorough. <br />
        Limitations – social anxiety, easily frustrated, take criticism
        personally, and imposter syndrome.
      </p>
      <li>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </li>
      <p>
        Increase my self-confidence, my public speaking ability, and improve my
        receptiveness to criticism/feedback.
      </p>
      <li>How will you manage your workload in this programme?</li>
      <p>
        I plan to work steadily throughout this course, making a commitment to
        doing at least 30min of coursework on the weekends as well. I also have
        no other full-time responsibilities – like kids or work.
      </p>
      <p>
        If things are building up and getting to me, I am likely to reach out
        for support and let the facilitator know. This is a significant issue
        for me, because I still have lingering energy issues and occasionally
        need to stop and take a nap if I’ve been working too much.
      </p>
      <li>How and where you will seek help in a timely way?</li>
      <p>
        My partner has been through a lot with my illness in the last year, and
        is very aware of how I am when I am not doing well. If I do not start to
        seek help (which I am also very likely to do), he will make sure that I
        follow through. It depends a lot on the help that I need, technical help
        could be gained from google, my partner, my homegroup, my facilitator.
        And emotional help will be from my partner and close friends.
      </p>
      <li>What do you expect from the Facilitation team?</li>
      <p>
        To help me develop my programming skills by letting me learn, and
        answering questions when things are too hard to google. Make sure I
        don’t fall behind, and let me know that is important to focus on, but
        what can also be neglected for now if timing doesn’t allow. I’d also
        appreciate positive feedback (especially if I already have negative
        feedback), it’s important for me to know I’m on the right track and that
        my work isn’t awful.
      </p>
      <li>
        Do you have any scheduling information such as block-out times when you
        are committed to other things?
      </li>
      <p>
        I have a few extremely important events (which will hopefully not impact
        my bootcamp experience) but will be a significant drain on my energy. I
        have a hen’s weekend, my best friend’s wedding, and my partners 30th
        birthday all in October. If I was well, none of these things would be an
        issue, but my illness can flare unexpectedly.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is possible that I will need to recover from one or all of these
        weekends and may lose a Monday here or there.
      </p>
