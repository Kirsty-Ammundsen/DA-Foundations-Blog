        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </li>
      <p>
        The Core learning has allowed me to explore my new priorities in life
        (after being sick) which solidifies my decision to leave medicine (even
        though I still feel bittersweet about it). It's also taught me my
        emotional intelligence is poor if I can't improve my ability to
        self-regulate (which is a hit to my ego). My third thing it's taught me
        about is the growth mindset, and things I should change to be more
        positive about failing.
      </p>
      <li>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </li>
      <p>
        Programming can be incredibly frustrating. Amazingly so. To overcome
        this, you do need to be kind to yourself, forgive yourself for 'silly
        mistakes', and understand when your body/mind has reached its limits.
        This is the same with learning anything new. It's important to have the
        goal of improving and getting better, not to just be talented and make
        no mistakes.
      </p>
      <li>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</li>
      <p>
        That you can make it easy or hard for yourself, depending on how deeply
        you think about things. I'm also surprised that there is some new core
        concept to learn every week.
      </p>
      <li>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</li>
      <p>
        I definitely found the identity and values module super hard. I think I
        thought about it way too deeply, and felt concerned I would be judged by
        complete strangers. Now, I just assume zero people are reading these
        blogs and it helps me to write better.
      </p>
      <li>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </li>
      <p>
        Core learning is important to make well-rounded programmers. It is
        something you have noticed in industry, and that is why you are
        including it as part of our programme. Most programmers work with teams
        of people, therefore an ability to work well as part of a team (by
        having a good background in these core concepts) is a great asset.
      </p>
      <li>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </li>
      <p>
        Core learning has (at times) been more frustrating to work through than
        programming. I feel that maybe there could be less of the Core content?
        However, especially for people who have never seen these concepts
        before, it can give people some life epiphanies. I feel like I have seen
        most of these things before, but never really made much use of it, it
        has been good for me to think more deeply about my life and what could
        be better.
