    <h3>Principles of Neuroplasticity</h3>
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity benefits anyone who has had an injury to the brain, and
      anyone needing to expand their knowledge. Neuroplasticity refers to the
      brain's ability to make new pathways and strengthen old ones. This feature
      allows the brain to learn, improve, and forge new connections to replace
      old, broken ones. I have definitely benefitted from neuroplasticity - when
      my brain was damaged due to Long Covid, I had moderate memory impairment.
      This has improved significantly over the last year as I slowly returned to
      doing my daily tasks of living, slept up to 14 hours a day, did some
      travelling, and started to learn how to code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ways to increase neuroplasticity: learning a new language or instrument,
      travelling, making art, reading, sleeping well, exercising regularly,
      being mindful, and playing games.

    <h3>The Growth Mindset</h3>
    <p>
      The Growth Mindset is a way of thinking that is focused on curiousity and
      learning. It is centred on the fact that people can improve as brains have
      neuroplasticity, and you don't need to be stuck with the level of
      knowledge and ability you have currently. You can always be better.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this exploration, I considered what it meant for me and what kind
      of mindset I have. I think I have always known that study and hard work
      would be able to improve my knowledge. However, I think from a young age,
      my mindset has been tilted towards the idea that if you work really hard,
      you aren't that naturally bright, and that making mistakes is terrible. I
      want to try reassessing this world view, and try to not chastise myself
      too hard when I am wrong. I think that getting into the mindset that
      mistakes = learning = okay will help me to overcome my fear of being
      incorrect.

    <h3>Influence on my Learning Plan</h3>
    <p>
      I think that changing my mindset to a growth mindset will help with my
      limitations that I stated in the learning plan - it will help with my
      self-confidence, and it should improve my receptiveness to criticism and
      general feedback.
