    <h2>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</h2>
    <p class="date"><strong>5 September 2023</strong></p>

    <p>
      Using CSS, there are countless ways to display HTML information. One of
      these ways is by using the display property to show an element as a
      'block', 'inline', or combining properties of both into 'inline-block'.
    </p>

    <h3>Block</h3>
    <p>
      - allows the user to modify the height and width of an element, however,
      it will create a line break (so that no elements are on the same line).
    </p>
    <p>
      This what I have written in CSS to make the text appear as it does below:
    </p>
    <img
      class="blog-img"
      src="../images/block.png"
      alt="CSS code showing display:block"
    />
    <p>
      "Te Houtaewa was the <span class="block">fastest</span>
      <span class="block">runner</span> of his day and played many pranks on his
      peoples enemies."
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can see, the "block" property allows you to modify the margins and
      padding, but by default will try to take up the whole width of the screen.
      Even if you changed the width to less than 50% of the screen, it would
      change the size of the box but the two boxes will not line up one next to
      the other.
    </p>

    <h3>Inline</h3>
    <p>
      - does not allow the user to modify the height and width of an element,
      however, it will allow all elements to stay on the same line.
    </p>
    <p>
      This what I have written in CSS to make the text look as it does below:
    </p>
    <img
      class="blog-img"
      src="../images/block.png"
      alt="CSS code showing display:block"
    />
    <p>
      "Instead of going to the <span class="inline">nearby</span>
      <span class="inline">gardens</span>, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he
      wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there."
    </p>

    <h3>Inline-block</h3>
    <p>
      - allows the user to modify the height and width of an element, however,
      it will allow all elements to stay on the same line. Thus combining
      elements of both the named properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      This what I have written in CSS to make the text look as it does below:
    </p>
    <img
      class="blog-img"
      src="../images/inline-block.png"
      alt="CSS code showing display:block"
    />
    <p>
      "While Te Houtaewa was filling his
      <span class="inline-block">baskets</span>
      <span class="inline-block">with</span> kumara he was spotted stealing the
      kai (food). He was immediately recognised."
