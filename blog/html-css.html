    <h2>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</h2>
    <p class="date"><strong>5 September 2023</strong></p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Using CSS, there are countless ways to display HTML information. One of
      these ways is by using the display property to show an HTML element as a
      'block', 'inline', or combining properties of both into 'inline-block'.
      <br />
      <br />
      Note: An HTML element is defined as the start tag, some content, and the
      end tag. In the examples below, I have placed individual words between
      HTML &#60;span&#62; tags.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Block</h3>
    <p>
      - allows the user to modify the height and width of an element, however,
      it will create a line break (so that no elements are on the same line).
    </p>
    <p>
      This what I have written in CSS to make the text appear as it does below:
    </p>
    <img
      class="blog-img"
      src="../images/block.png"
      alt="CSS code showing display:block"
    />
    <div class="css-example">
      <p>
        "Te Houtaewa was the <span class="block">fastest</span>
        <span class="block">runner</span> of his day and played many pranks on
        his peoples enemies."
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      As you can see, the "block" property allows you to modify the height,
      width, margins and padding, but by default will try to take up the whole
      width of the screen. Even if you change the width to less than 50% of the
      screen (as I have done), it would change the size of the box but the two
      boxes will not line up one next to the other.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Inline</h3>
    <p>
      - does not allow the user to modify the height and width of an element,
      however, it will allow all elements to stay on the same line (if space
      allows).
    </p>

    <p>
      This what I have written in CSS to make the text appear as it does below:
    </p>
    <img
      class="blog-img"
      src="../images/inline.png"
      alt="CSS code showing display:block"
    />
    <div class="css-example">
      <p>
        "Instead of going to the <span class="inline">nearby</span>
        <span class="inline">gardens</span>, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as
        he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there."
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      In the example above, the height and width applied to the element are
      ignored, but the text stays "in line" with each other. If you widen and
      narrow the screen, the words want to be sitting next to each other unlike
      the example above. It also displays padding all around, but ignores margin
      on the top and bottom only (making this example look rather messy).
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Inline block</h3>
    <p>
      - allows the user to modify the height and width of an element, however,
      it will allow all elements to stay on the same line. Thus combining traits
      of both the named properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      This what I have written in CSS to make the text appear as it does below:
    </p>
    <img
      class="blog-img"
      src="../images/inline-block.png"
      alt="CSS code showing display:block"
    />
    <div class="css-example">
      <p>
        "While Te Houtaewa was filling his
        <span class="inline-block">baskets</span>
        <span class="inline-block">with</span> kumara he was spotted stealing
        the kai (food). He was immediately recognised."
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      This last example shows properties of both inline and block (as the name
      suggests). It allows you to change all properties: height, width, margins,
      and padding. But it also tries to be "in line" as much as possible with
      one element coming directly after the other. Again, widen or narrow the
      screen to see how the boxes move relative to each other.
