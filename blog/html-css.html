    <h2>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</h2>
    <p class="date"><strong>5 September 2023</strong></p>

    <p>
      Within CSS, there are many ways to display HTML information. One of these
      ways is by using the display property to show content as a 'block',
      'inline', or combining properties of both into 'inline-block'.
    </p>

    <h3>Block</h3>
    <p>
      - allows the user to modify the height and width of an element, however,
      it will create a line break (so that no elements are on the same line).
    </p>
    <p>
      This what I have written in CSS to make the text look as it does below:
    </p>
    <img class="blog-img" src="#" alt="CSS code showing display:block" />
    <p>
      Te Houtaewa was the <span class="block">fastest</span>
      <span class="block">runner</span> of his day and played many pranks on his
      peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi (earth
      oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short
      distance away.
    </p>

    <h3>Inline</h3>
    <p>
      - does not allow the user to modify the height and width of an element,
      however, it will allow all elements to stay on the same line.
    </p>
    <p>
      This what I have written in CSS to make the text look as it does below:
    </p>
    <img class="blog-img" src="#" alt="CSS code showing display:block" />
    <p>
      Instead of going to the <span class="inline">nearby</span>
      <span class="inline">gardens</span>, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he
      wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there.
    </p>

    <h3>Inline-block</h3>
    <p>
      - allows the user to modify the height and width of an element, however,
      it will allow all elements to stay on the same line. Thus combining
      elements of both the named properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      This what I have written in CSS to make the text look as it does below:
    </p>
    <img class="blog-img" src="#" alt="CSS code showing display:block" />
    <p>
      While Te Houtaewa was filling his <span class="inline">baskets</span>
      <span class="inline">with</span> kumara he was spotted stealing the kai
      (food). He was immediately recognised.
