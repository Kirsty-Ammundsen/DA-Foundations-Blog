    <!-- were blocked on a simple problem:
using snippets tool constantly and console.log at each step

    elegantly solved a problem.
    used snippets and realised i had to make another array and push the results to the new one because i wasn't getting an array back (fizzbuzz)
       used youtube, slowly worked through the problem using only things I understood and console.log each step to problem solve it.
       Tried to make a whole thing work at once, but it didn't, so i took it into pieces that i understood, removed the function and worked in smaller chunks.

    Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:


    Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
  

    using lots of googling with mdn and w3schools to find solutions to simple problems. 
    the test didn't work so i reached out for help in discord - however unsure how the test started working again
    before i did that, i googled and used the snippet function with console.log to check my code worked

    read error messages - wasn't working, managed to use pseudocode to block everything that looked like it could be causing errors.  waited until test system was operational again. then it passed

    <h3>Simple Problem</h3>
    <p>
      A simple problem would be 'I don't know how to use the map function to
      make it look over the words". For something like this, I tried reading MDN
      Web Docs.. Didn't understand it. Then went and watched a youtube video
      which gave examples and explanations in real time. I found youtube helped
      me with harder to understand methods better than reading a document. I
      usually just felt content and curious for simple problems, and would learn
      new things like how to use a new function.
    </p>
    <h3>Elegant Solution</h3>
    <p>
      For me, the deBuzz challenge was hard and I was so excited to be almost
      there with the answer. I made the computer run and to my great
      disappointment - instead of all the buzzes being cut out - the console
      just said, 'buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz'. I was kicking myself, annoyed I'd
      gotten it the wrong way around. I was wondering how I was going to cut the
      buzzes out of the array... When I had a thought that I could use the NOT
      function (!) to reverse my buzz finder into an anti-buzz finder. This was
      a very pleasing solution to my problems and I was sooo happy I didn't have
      to do a lot more work to solve it.

    <h3>Using Problem-Solving Techniques</h3>
    <p>
      During the JavaScript Kata Challenges, I definitely used a lot of
      pseudocode, trying something, reading error messages, console.logging and
      googling. Those were my mainstays of getting me out of drama, so now I'm
      feeling moderately confident in these methods. I did ask for help once
      when a test didn't run as I thought it should, and after bothering the
      coaches for a space of time, it magically fixed itself. I try to ask
      coaches and peers as a last resort if I'm taking too long with a
      challenge. I haven't tried the rubber ducky method, and don't use
      reflection if I'm not prompted to by Dev Academy!
    </p>
    <h3>Asking for Help</h3>
    <p>
      When thinking about asking for help, I am trying to consider this course
      like a job. Struggling a little and finding out the solution is beneficial
      for my learning and improvement as an employee. If I take too long - I am
      costing the business money and being too stubborn about getting the
      answer. In this scenario I should ask collegues for help. If I haven't
      tried very hard with getting to the solution myself (or experienced
      frustation that stopped me continuing to an answer), then I am wasting my
      colleagues brainpower and time which could be spent doing something else
      for the business.
