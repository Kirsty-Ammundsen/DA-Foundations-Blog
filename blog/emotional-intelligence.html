      I first learned about Emotional Intelligence (EQ) when I found a book
      about the subject by Daniel Goleman sitting on my parent's bookcase in
      high school. I read the book from cover to cover and currently barely
      remember what it contained - the gist was - emotional memory and trigger
      emotions are caused by the hippocampus and amygdala, and EQ is more
      important than the intelligence quotient (IQ) when it comes to career and
      relationship success.
    </p>
    <p>
      This small nugget of knowledge stuck with me for many, many years, but it
      took a lot of university lessons on mindfulness, and ultimately 'growing
      up' before I thought more about how these things should be implemented in
      my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going over all this again has reminded me of which EQ deficiences I have,
      and how I should work to overcome them. I defintely need to put a lot off
      my effort into self-regulation, and a way to do this would be by trying
      mindfulness everyday (something that links together with the goals Dev
      Academy already has for us).
