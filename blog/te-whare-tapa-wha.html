    <p>
      When I became unwell, life slowed down and I wasn't able to do much. With
      each new thing I've been able to do, I have learned not to take my energy
      forgranted, and I've tried my best within my physical and mental
      limitations to keep improving my wellbeing. Part of that is regaining
      strength, part of that is reconnecting with friends and family, part of
      that is appreciating nature, and being grateful for constant improvements
      to my health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to all of this, I have been working on my Te Whare Tapa Wha, so here
      are a list of things I already do within each of the domains:
    </p>

    <table class="te-whare">
      <tr>
        <th class="table-title">Wall</th>
        <th class="table-title">Activities</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</th>
        <th>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Going for walks around the neighbourhood with my partner before
              dinner.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ordering a Wonky Box of veg and fruit fortnightly (and cooking
              meals based on the ingredients).
            </li>
            <li>
              I make sure to get enough hours of sleep every night, and have a
              wind down schedule before bed.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing)</th>
        <th>
          <ul>
            <li>I make time every evening to spend with my partner.</li>
            <li>
              Every month, I catch up with my family by trying a new burger
              place.
            </li>
            <li>
              I keep in touch with friends via messaging apps and organise
              frequent meet-ups
            </li>
          </ul>
        </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</th>
        <th>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I'm very open with people about how I feel about things, and that
              helps me to get difficult emotions off my chest.
            </li>
            <li>Going for walks allows me to destress also.</li>
            <li>For everything else, there is chocolate.</li>
          </ul>
        </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</th>
        <th>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Appreciating nature while out on walks allows me to experience
              wairua.
            </li>
            <li>
              Being able to authentically be myself around my loved ones also
              makes me feel a sense of connectedness to my whanau.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)</th>
        <th>
          <ul>
            <li>
              While going out on walks, I appreciate the little things about
              nature. I love the colours of the sky, the view of houses on the
              hills, the birds fighting it out in the trees, and little streams
              I cross in the middle of urban areas.
            </li>
            <li>
              I also have some bonsai trees and house plants that bring me joy.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </th>
      </tr>
